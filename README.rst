What is it
==========

This is a copy of Greg Lavino's awesome `photo_splitter.py`, with some
minor adjustments by Daniel Nouri, updated to work with Python 3.10 by me.

Greg published his original code in a `ubunutuforums.org thread
<http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1429439&p=8975597#post8975597>`_.

`photo_splitter.py` is very useful if you need to crop a large amount
of images very quickly.  Simply select the areas in the image that you
want to crop, click "Go" and photo_splitter will create one image file
for each crop area for you, in the same folder as the original image.

Here's a screenshot from the `StackOverflow question
<http://askubuntu.com/questions/31250/fast-image-cropping>`_ which
features `photo_splitter.py` as the solution:

libraries::

An example::
